/***********************************NOTE:***********************************\
* This file is reserved for *SMALL* entities which do not have any more than
* two "logic gates" in them. For example two if statments.
*
* If the entity has more than two "logic gates", or you are in doubt, just
* create another file and put the entity in there. This is to avoid file
* conflics as entities which have more than one logic gate are much more
* prone to adjustment. Different files decreases the chances of file
* conflicts.
*
* Most tutorials use one file for entities - this is bad practice as we
* are using GitHub and planning to make this game bigger.
