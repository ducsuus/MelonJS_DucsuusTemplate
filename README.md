MelonJS - The Ducsuus Template

=====

This template is a template put together, designed to make a Pokemon style birds eye view game, which is set-up in a way hopefully easier to understand.

=====

A lot of content has been removed, this is mainly the bare bones of a MelonJS game. More or less this is a variation of the "official" MelonJS tutorial.

Stuff like particle effects can easily be implemented by adding a new JavaScript file and a few lines of code.
